    A filter rule strategy is specified as follows.
    If the daily closing price (in U.S. dollars) of a foreign currency goes up by x% or more from its most recent low,
    then the speculator borrows the dollar and uses the proceeds to buy the foreign currency.

    When the closing price of the foreign currency drops by at least y% from a subsequent high,
    the speculator short sells the foreign currency and uses the proceeds to buy the dollar.

    We define the subsequent high as the highest price over the e most recent days and the subsequent low as the lowest price over the e most recent days.
    We also consider the case where a given long or short position is held for c days during which time all other signals are ingored




    Basic Filter Rules:
    When the daily closing price of an asset moves up by over x% from its most recent low, the rule generates a "buy" forecast.
    When the daily closing price moves down by at least y% from a recent high, the rule generates a "sell" forecast.
    Otherwise, the forecast is "neutral".

    signal x = 0.0005, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.10 (6 values);

class MovingAverageRules(object):

    The moving average of a currency price for a given day is computed as the simple average of prices over the previous n days, including the current day.
    Under a moving average rule, when the short moving average of a foreign currency price is above the long moving average by an amount larger than the band with b%,
    the speculator borrows the dollar to buy the foreign currency.
    Similarly, when the short moving average is below the long moving average by b%,
    the speculator short sells the FX to buy the dollar.

    In addition to this fixed percentage band filter,
    we also implement the moving average rules with a time delay filter, which requires that the long or short signals remain valid for d days before he takes any action.
    As in the filter rule case, we also consider the case where a given long or short position is held for c days during which time all other signals are ignored


    Basic Moving Average Rule:
    First, to calculate the (equally-weighted) moving average of an asset prices for a given day t over the n days.
    When current price is above moving average, it generates a "buy" forecast;
    when current price is below moving average, it generates a "sell" forecast;
    otherwise, it generates a "neutral" forecast.
